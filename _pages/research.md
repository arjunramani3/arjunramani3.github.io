## Active work
- I currently work on the effect of work-from-home (WFH) on migration patterns and the real estate market with [Nick Bloom](https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu) at Stanford. My research is motivated by my broader interests in the social and economic consequences of technological change.
	- Read our [NBER working paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28876/w28876.pdf), [SIEPR policy brief](https://siepr.stanford.edu/research/publications/donut-effect-how-covid-19-shapes-real-estate) or [CEPR Vox column.](https://voxeu.org/article/doughnut-effect-covid-19-cities)
