## Work in progress
- I currently work on the effect of work-from-home (WFH) on migration patterns and the real estate market with [Nick Bloom](https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu) at Stanford. My research is motivated by my broader interests in how technology will restructure the future of work and how society can overcome [Baumol's cost disease.](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Baumol1967.pdf) 
	- Read our [NBER working paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28876/w28876.pdf), [SIEPR policy brief](https://siepr.stanford.edu/research/publications/donut-effect-how-covid-19-shapes-real-estate) or [CEPR Vox column.](https://voxeu.org/article/doughnut-effect-covid-19-cities)


## Past research
- From 2018-2021 I worked with [Naomi Feldman](https://naomifeldman.com) and [Kevin Corinth](https://sites.google.com/view/kevincorinth/about-me) to estimate the causal effects of the Opportunity Zone provision of the 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on neigborhood economies.

- From 2020-2021 I worked for [Pete Klenow](http://www.klenow.com) on his project with [Chad Jones](https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/) at Stanford studying the disparity between Black and White Americans over the past four decades using a new consumption-equivalent welfare metric that incorporates consumption, leisure, inequality, health status, unemployment, and incarceration.

- From 2019-2020 I worked with [Ramin Toloui](https://siepr.stanford.edu/people/ramin-toloui) at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR) to develop Stanford's first course on the economics of artifical intelligence.

- From 2015-2017 I worked with [David Gleich](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/) at Purdue on algorithms for efficient generation of large random networks. Our work was published at [SIAM Review](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/17M1127132) and [ICDM](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/publications/Eikmeier%202018%20-%20hyperkron.pdf).
