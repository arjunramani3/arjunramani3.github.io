### Work in progress
- I am writing my honors thesis in economics on the effect of work-from-home on the real estate market. I a particularly interested in measuring the extent to which workers in the long-term will spatially reallocate away from cities with high housing costs in response to the growing ability to live away from their place of work. My advisors are Nick Bloom and Pete Klenow at Stanford.
