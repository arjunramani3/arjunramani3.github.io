## Work in progress
- I am writing my honors thesis in economics on the effect of work-from-home (WFH) on the real estate market. I am particularly interested in measuring the extent to which the spatial reallocaiton of workers away from cities depends on the following three factors: (i) exposure of a city to remote work (e.g. tech jobs in SF) (ii) high cost of living (e.g. housing) and (iii) the presence of urban amenities (e.g. NYC food scene). My thesis is motivated by my broader interests in how technology will restructure the future of work and how society can overcome [Baumol's cost disease.](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Baumol1967.pdf) My advisors are [Nick Bloom](https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu) and [Pete Klenow](http://www.klenow.com) at Stanford.
	- I've written about WFH and real estate for [SIEPR](https://siepr.stanford.edu/research/publications/donut-effect-how-covid-19-shapes-real-estate) and [CEPR Vox](https://voxeu.org/article/doughnut-effect-covid-19-cities)

- I am working with [Naomi Feldman](https://naomifeldman.com) and [Kevin Corinth](https://sites.google.com/view/kevincorinth/about-me) to estimate the causal effects of the Opporunity Zone provision of the 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on neigborhood economies.

## Other research-related activities
- I am currently an RA for [Pete Klenow](http://www.klenow.com) on his project with [Chad Jones](https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/) at Stanford studying the dispartity between Black and White Americans over the past four decades using a new consumption-equivalent welfare metric that incorporates consumption, leisure, inequality, health status, unemployment, and incarceration.

- I have worked with [Ramin Toloui](https://siepr.stanford.edu/people/ramin-toloui) at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR) to develop Stanford's first course on the economics of artifical intelligence.
