I'm a student at Stanford studying economics, mathematics, and computer science. My research interests include understanding the drivers of innovation, the consequences of monetary policy to inequality, and how individuals/groups can be empowered to make more impactful choices. I am writing my senior thesis on how work-from-home is affecting real estate markets. 

#### In addition to research, here are some other things I care about

- Data journalism: I am currently the editor of the data journalism section of [The Stanford Daily](https://stanforddaily.com) and have worked on stories [tracking covid on campus](https://stanforddaily.com/2020/10/11/tracking-covid-19-at-stanford/), [understanding Stanford's finances](https://stanforddaily.com/2020/03/05/stanford-as-a-vc/), and [gauging student opinion on campus politics and society through student surveys.](https://stanforddaily.com/2020/06/14/the-class-of-2020-by-the-numbers/). 

- Open data: A topic I am passionate about is making data @Stanford more accessible to empower journalists and community members to better understand Stanford and push for change. A group of students and I recently started the [Stanford Open Data Project](https://stanfordopendata.org/#/) to achieve these goals. We recently launched our flagship Stanford Open Data Portal and will soon be hosting the first-ever general interest datathon on Stanford's campus with an explicit focus on longer-term projects. Check out our portal [here!](https://stanfordopendata.org/#/)
