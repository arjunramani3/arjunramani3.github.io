I am a PhD candidate in economics at MIT interested in technological change, industrial policy and growth. In [new work](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28876/w28876.pdf) forthcoming in PNAS I along with Nick Boom and Joel Alcedo show how working-from-home has led to a "donut effect" in the world's largest cities. You can read about earlier versions of this project in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/02/opinion/cities-remote-work-economy.html), [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pandemic-urban-decay-and-economic-renewal-11659038760) and [The Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/c7a3b822-0a98-4a95-9b49-63f0b96d9e98).

Before my PhD, I was a journalist for The Economist for three years and reported mostly from London and India. In the spring of 2024 I wrote a six-part special report on [India's economy](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2024/04/22/for-its-next-phase-of-growth-india-needs-a-new-reform-agenda) with Tom Easton. Other recent pieces include a look at why [elites like Modi](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/03/29/why-indias-elite-loves-narendra-modi), a look at the [GDP growth rate debate](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/04/11/how-fast-is-indias-economy-really-growing), and an assessment of Modi's flagship industrial policy ([PLIs](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/05/16/narendra-modis-flagship-growth-scheme-is-off-to-a-sluggish-start)). I was recently on [Ideas of India with Shruti Rajagopalan](https://www.mercatus.org/ideasofindia/arjun-ramani-and-thomas-easton-decode-indias-changing-economic-landscape) and [Crash Course with Michael Walker](https://www.patreon.com/posts/future-of-1-4-on-105055874) to talk about India.

In 2023, I wrote a lot about AI. Some favourites include a sci-fi inspired piece on what [humans might do](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/23/what-would-humans-do-in-a-world-of-super-ai) in a world of superintelligence, based on economic theory. I also very much like a piece co-written with Callum Williams on why the [diffusion](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/16/your-employer-is-probably-unprepared-for-artificial-intelligence) of AI will be slow. Callum and my reporting on the economics of AI was [shortlisted](https://wincott.co.uk/wincott-shortlists-winners-to-be-announced-at-mansion-house-lunch-on-may-16/) for Journalist of the Year by the Wincott Foundation. Zhengdong Wang of DeepMind and I built on these themes in a recent essay published in The Gradient on the various [bottlenecks](https://thegradient.pub/why-transformative-artificial-intelligence-is-really-really-hard-to-achieve/) to rapid economic growth from AI. This is probably the most comprehensive record of my views on the technology. 

I was born and raised in West Lafayette, Indiana, and love tennis, basketball and science fiction novels. If you'd like to chat about research or writing please reach out at asramani 'at' mit 'dot' edu.
