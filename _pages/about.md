I'm a student at Stanford studying econ, math, and cs. My research interests include the future of work, monetary poliyc, and the economics of housing/real estate - I am writing my senior thesis on how work-from-home is affecting real estate markets. I am currently the editor of the data journalism section of [The Stanford Daily](https://stanforddaily.com) and have worked on stories [tracking covid on campus](https://stanforddaily.com/2020/10/11/tracking-covid-19-at-stanford/), [understanding Stanford's finances](https://stanforddaily.com/2020/03/05/stanford-as-a-vc/), and [gauging student opinion on campus politics](https://stanforddaily.com/2020/09/28/i-will-miss-everything-student-survey-shows-changed-plans-for-many-in-the-new-academic-year/) and [the world more broadly through student surveys](https://stanforddaily.com/2020/06/14/the-class-of-2020-by-the-numbers/). 


### Open Data at Stanford
A topic I am passionate about is making data @Stanford more accessible to empower journalists and community members to better understand Stanford and push for change. A group of students and I recently started the [Stanford Open Data Project](https://stanfordopendata.org/#/), a student organization dedicated to improving data accessibility at Stanford as well as empowering students with the tools needed to analyze said data. We recently launched our flagship Stanford Open Data Portal and will soon be hosting the first-ever general interest datathon on Stanford's campus with an explicit focus on public interest longer-term projects. Check out our portal [here!](https://stanfordopendata.org/#/)
