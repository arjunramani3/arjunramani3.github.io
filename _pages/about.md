I'm an economist and journalist with a focus on technology, finance and macroeconomics. I cover the global economy for <i>The Economist</i> in London. My recent features examine the US-China [tech race](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/10/13/china-and-the-west-are-in-a-race-to-foster-innovation), the [restructuring](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/11/23/the-bright-new-age-of-venture-capital/21806438) of [venture capital](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/11/27/adventure-capitalism) and how [economics research](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/10/23/enter-third-wave-economics) changed during the Covid era. Previously I've spent time on various trading desks at Citadel.

I graduated with honors from Stanford where I studied economics and computer science and was a Kennedy Prize winner for best thesis. I continue to do academic work with Nick Bloom at Stanford. My most recent [paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28876/w28876.pdf) shows how working-from-home has led to a "donut effect" in America's largest cities and has been covered by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/americans-are-done-with-5-days-a-week-in-the-office-here-s-what-that-means-for-the-economy), [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pandemic-urban-decay-and-economic-renewal-11659038760) and [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/07/04/covid-19-has-persuaded-americans-to-leave-city-centres) among other outlets.

I love traveling the world, meeting new people and finding out what drives them. If you'd like to chat or have a story idea please reach out at arjunramani 'at' economist 'dot' com.
