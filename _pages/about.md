I'm a student at Stanford studying economics, mathematics, and computer science. My research interests include understanding the causes and consequences of technical change & innovation, how monetary policy intereacts with the real economy, and how individuals/groups can be empowered to make more impactful choices. I am currently studying the impact of working-from-home on migration patterns and real estate markets, a project borne out of my senior thesis. See this [working paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28876/w28876.pdf) to read about the findings or see these policy briefs from [SIEPR](https://siepr.stanford.edu/research/publications/donut-effect-how-covid-19-shapes-real-estate) or [CEPR Vox](https://voxeu.org/article/doughnut-effect-covid-19-cities) for a quicker overview.

### In addition to research, here are some other things I care about:

- Data journalism & open data: At Stanford, I previously edited the data journalism section of [The Stanford Daily](https://stanforddaily.com) and have worked on stories [tracking covid on campus](https://stanforddaily.com/2020/10/11/tracking-covid-19-at-stanford/), [understanding Stanford's finances](https://stanforddaily.com/2020/03/05/stanford-as-a-vc/), and [gauging student opinion on campus politics and society through student surveys.](https://stanforddaily.com/2020/06/14/the-class-of-2020-by-the-numbers/). A topic I am passionate about is making data @Stanford and elsewhere more accessible to empower journalists and community members to better understand their communities and push for change. Check out a project I worked on called the [Stanford Open Data Project](https://stanfordopendata.org/#/) and get in touch if you're interested in doing something similar at your own school!
