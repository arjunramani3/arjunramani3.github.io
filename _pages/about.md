I write for The Economist about macroeconomics, technology and finance. After two years writing from London, I am now doing an extended stint in Mumbai and Delhi to cover India's economy. My views are outlined in a six-part special report on [India's economy](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2024/04/22/for-its-next-phase-of-growth-india-needs-a-new-reform-agenda) that I have written with Tom Easton.

In 2023, I wrote a lot about AI. Some favourites include a sci-fi inspired piece on what [humans might do](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/23/what-would-humans-do-in-a-world-of-super-ai) in a world of superintelligence, based on economics first principles. I also very much like a piece co-written with Callum Williams on why the [diffusion](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/16/your-employer-is-probably-unprepared-for-artificial-intelligence) of AI will be slow. Zhengdong Wang of DeepMind and I built on these themes in a recent essay published in The Gradient on the various [bottlenecks](https://thegradient.pub/why-transformative-artificial-intelligence-is-really-really-hard-to-achieve/) to rapid economic growth from AI. This is probably the most comprehensive record of my views on the technology.

Outside of journalism, I do economics research with Nick Bloom at Stanford, which is also where I did my undergrad in economics and masters in computer science. Our most recent [paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28876/w28876.pdf) shows how working-from-home has led to a "donut effect" in America's largest cities and has been covered by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/02/opinion/cities-remote-work-economy.html), [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pandemic-urban-decay-and-economic-renewal-11659038760) and [The Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/c7a3b822-0a98-4a95-9b49-63f0b96d9e98), among other outlets. I like bringing new micro data to questions of macroeconomic importance.

I was born and raised in West Lafayette, Indiana, and love tennis, basketball and science fiction novels. If you'd like to chat or have a story idea please reach out at arjunramani 'at' economist 'dot' com.
