I'm an economist and journalist and work on technological change, finance and macroeconomics. I currently write for __The Economist__ in London and have recently covered a real-time revolution in economics & policy, inflation, and green finance. I studied economics and computer science at Stanford and continue to do research at the Stanford Institue for Economic Policy Research with Nick Bloom and Pete Klenow. My most recent [paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28876/w28876.pdf) shows how working-from-home has led to a "donut effect" in America's largest cities and was covered by Bloomberg, Vox and The Economist among other outlets.

### Some other things about me:

- At Stanford, I edited the data journalism section of [The Stanford Daily](https://stanforddaily.com) and worked on stories about [covid on campus](https://stanforddaily.cosm/2020/10/11/tracking-covid-19-at-stanford/), [Stanford's finances](https://stanforddaily.com/2020/03/05/stanford-as-a-vc/) and [student opinion on campus politics and society.](https://stanforddaily.com/2020/06/14/the-class-of-2020-by-the-numbers/). I launched a new biannual survey of student opion on campus politics and the world at large worked to open up data @Stanford by helping build the [Stanford Open Data Project](https://stanfordopendata.org/#/)
