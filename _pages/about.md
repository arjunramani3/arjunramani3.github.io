I'm an economist and journalist and work on the economics of innovation, finance and macroeconomics. I currently write about global economics for <i>The Economist</i> in London. My recent pieces have covered [real-time revolution in economics & policy](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/10/23/enter-third-wave-economics), [inflation](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/11/06/a-handful-of-items-are-driving-inflation-in-america), and [green finance](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/10/09/a-wave-of-green-government-bonds-is-flooding-markets). I studied economics and computer science at Stanford and continue to do research at the Stanford Institue for Economic Policy Research with Nick Bloom and Pete Klenow. My most recent [paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28876/w28876.pdf) shows how working-from-home has led to a "donut effect" in America's largest cities and has been covered by Bloomberg, Vox and The Economist among other outlets. I love traveling and meeting new people. If you'd like to chat or have a story idea please reach out at arjunramani 'at' economist 'dot' com.
