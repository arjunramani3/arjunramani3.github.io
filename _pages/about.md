I'm an economist and journalist with a focus on technology, finance and macroeconomics. I currently cover the global economy for <i>The Economist</i> in London. My recent features include the [restructuring](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/11/23/the-bright-new-age-of-venture-capital/21806438) of [venture capital](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/11/27/adventure-capitalism), [economic policy](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/10/23/enter-third-wave-economics) in the Covid era and a new way of measuring [inflation concentration](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/11/06/a-handful-of-items-are-driving-inflation-in-america). Previously I worked on an emerging markets trading desk at Citadel and on economic policy at the White House Council of Economic Advisors.

I graduated with honors from Stanford University where I studied economics and computer science and was a Kennedy Prize winner. I edited the data journalism section of the school newspaper, The Stanford Daily, and worked to improve campus data transparency. I continue to do research with Stanford University Professor Nick Bloom. My most recent [paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28876/w28876.pdf) shows how working-from-home has led to a "donut effect" in America's largest cities and has been covered by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/americans-are-done-with-5-days-a-week-in-the-office-here-s-what-that-means-for-the-economy), [Vox](https://www.vox.com/recode/22714777/remote-work-from-home-city-suburbs-housing-traffic) and [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/07/04/covid-19-has-persuaded-americans-to-leave-city-centres) among other outlets. 

I love traveling the world, meeting new people and finding out what drives them. If you'd like to chat or have a story idea please reach out at arjunramani 'at' economist 'dot' com.
