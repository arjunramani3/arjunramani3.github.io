Welcome to my personal blog! The purpose of this blog is to record my thoughts on politics, economics, statistics, and more in a public shareable setting. My hope is that by writing at more depth and receiving feedback/criticsm, I'll be forced to learn more and develop my ideas further. In addition, a lot of my posts will likely be content that is derived from other mediums (Twitter posts, <i>Stanford Daily<i> articles, research papers etc) or will eventually end up in one of those mediums. 

The name of this blog is <b>Thinking slow and slower</b>, a play on the book <i>Thinking Fast and Slow</i> by Kahneman and Tversky that popularized many of their Nobel Prize winning ideas in behavioral economics. I think the name is emblematic of one of my primary goals in this space - to deliberate on the things I care about in the hope that some of these ideas are valuable enough to turn into things that I think about even slower later on. Basically, this blog as a public scratchpad.
